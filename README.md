# SneakerTrack

SneakerTrack is web app designed to keep track of the current most popular sneakers and their price-trends with live information updates.

Sneakers, especially rare and sought-after pairs, are impossible to get nowadays. This forces us to look to the third-party aftermarket. SneakerTrack condenses information and makes it easier and quicker to read. With live-price updates, price-history graphs and much more.
