# SneakerTrack

SneakerTrack is data-visualization web-app designed to keep track of the current most popular sneakers and their price-trends.

Sneakers, especially rare and sought-after pairs, are impossible to get nowadays. This forces us to look to the third-party aftermarket. SneakerTrack condenses information and makes it easier and quicker to read.
