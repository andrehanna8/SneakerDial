    ProductDescription: "Hype for the new Air Jordan 4 Taupe Haze started brewing when the teasers of the sneakers surfaced, with sneakerheads noting their similarities to Travis Scott’s unreleased Air Jordan 4 Olive. Despite being compared to such a hyped sneaker, the Air Jordan 4 Taupe Haze has characteristics that allow it to stand out on its own. The Air Jordan 4 Taupe Haze features a unique design that elevates the popular Jordan model. The upper holds cracked textures on the forefoot, midfoot, and tongue, with lighter shades of Taupe Haze under the top coat. From there, hits of black appear on the outsole, midsole, and eyelets. An Infrared Jumpman logo on the tongue brightens up the tonal sneaker and completes its overall design.",
