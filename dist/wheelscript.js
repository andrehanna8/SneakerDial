You can’t talk about the Jordan 3 without talking about its legendary designer, Tinker Hatfield. Tinker’s superhero status amongst sneaker enthusiasts comes directly from groundbreaking designs like the Air Jordan 3. Not to say that a guy by the name of Michael Jordan didn’t have a little to do with it. After all, MJ did wear the Air Jordan 3 \"Black Cement\" to play in the 1988 NBA All Star Game. but as the memories of MJ wearing the shoes continue to fade, the Black Cement AJ3 has remained one of the most important sneakers of all time, especially off the court. The Black Cement Jordan 3 is one of those styles that every collector should own and in turn, even those not as die-hard about collecting shoes also grab these, which seems to keep the price well above other common colorways. Regardless whether you’re out to collect or wear your kicks, the style of the Jordan 3, with it’s black upper and Elephant Print \"Cement\" colored details are timeless and when the 2001 \"Black Cement\" Air Jordan 3 released, we were all once again reminded just how far Michael Jordan’s influence can reach.",

From there, the upper is met with a white and black midsole, with hits of an icy blue outsole appear as well. The final touch to this OG’s return is the signature \"Nike Air\" on the heel, replacing 2008 and 2012 retros’ \"Jumpman\" logo.",
